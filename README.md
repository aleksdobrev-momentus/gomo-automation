## Locators homework general requirements

For this homework, you'll have to create several CSS locators.
Create a new branch following the pattern `test-hmw-[homework number]-your-name`. For example:

`test-hmw-1-firstname-lastname`

After that, create a folder with your name `Firstname-Lastname` in the project's root folder. In that folder, add a text file with the homework name and the locators. For the second and third homework use the same folder.

When you are done, push the changes to the repo and create a Pull Request. Invite your colleagues to review your changes and after the PR is approved, merge to the main branch and delete your feature branch.
