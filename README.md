## Locators homework general requirements

For this homework you'll have to create several CSS locators.
Create a new branch following the pattern `test-hmw-[homework number]-your-name`. For example:

`test-hmw-1-firstname-lastname`

After that create a folder with your name `Firstname-Lastname` in the root folder of the project. In that folder, add a text file with the name of the homework and in it put the locators.

When you are done, push the changes to the repo and create a Pull Request. Invite the colleagues to review your changes and after the PR is approved, merge to the main branch and delete your feature branch.
